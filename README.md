Don't expect too much! This shader might be not useful in your project because of its lack of versatility.

System Requirements
-------------------

Unity 5.1 or later versions.

Compatibility
-------------

KvantSwarm needs a 4-component floating-point texture format. Basically, it
means it runs only on desktop/laptop-class GPUs.
